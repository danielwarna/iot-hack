# iot-hack
This is a Python / Flask / SQLite project for collecting and viewing (acrobatic) accelerometer data from a [Thingsee](https://thingsee.com/). It was made during a hackathon, so it comes complete with sleep deprivation-caused bugs and stupid commit messages.

This code

- can receive data from a Thingsee using JSON API
- can import data from the Thingsee SD card text log 
- can show pjuutiful zoomable graphs
- can calculate points of interest based on standard deviations in the data
